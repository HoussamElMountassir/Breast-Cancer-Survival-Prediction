# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction

You have a dataset of over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of breast cancer. Below is the information of all columns in the dataset:

Patient_ID: ID of the patient
Age: Age of the patient
Gender: Gender of the patient
Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: expression levels
Tumor_Stage: Breast cancer stage of the patient
Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma
ER status: Positive/Negative
PR status: Positive/Negative
HER2 status: Positive/Negative
Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other
DateofSurgery: The date of Surgery
DateofLast_Visit: The date of the last visit of the patient
Patient_Status: Alive/Dead
So by using this dataset, our task is to predict whether a breast cancer patient will survive or not after the surgery.

I hope you have an overview of the dataset we are using for the task of breast cancer survival prediction. Now, in the section below, I will walk you through the task of predicting breast cancer survival with machine learning using Python.
